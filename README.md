# Duly Noted
[Link to application hosted on Heroku](https://pure-scrubland-31598.herokuapp.com/)

I was given some front end code for a note taking app and was tasked with completing the back end.

## Process
I was able to use the index.js file supplied to me in the public folder in order to work out the routes that were necessary for the program. The first routes were easy, simple get and posts. But as I attempted to write the delete route without actually being taught it in class, I realize I would have to do a bit of internet research. After a couple hours I got it working perfectly and I'm very happy with it. Then added the final touches, detailed comments in my code, detailed readme, and hosted on heroku.
